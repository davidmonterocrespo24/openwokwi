/**
 * proBoardRegistry — runtime registration seam for boards a private overlay
 * (velxio.com) ships outside the OSS tree.
 *
 * The OSS BoardKind union and its compiler-enforced Record maps stay exactly
 * as they are for the open boards. An overlay calls registerProBoards() at
 * mount with data-only definitions; registration patches the exported maps in
 * types/board.ts (labels / FQBN / MicroPython set) so every existing read site
 * keeps working untouched, and the handful of sites a map can't cover (canvas
 * render, pin-name mapping, simulator construction, firmware load) consult
 * getProBoard() as a fallback.
 *
 * The OSS build never registers anything here — like the proRoutes /
 * __velxio_pro_gate__ / registerComponentDoc seams, this module is dead code
 * until an overlay imports it. Board ad cards (ONLINE_ONLY_BOARD_ADS) hide
 * automatically for registered kinds: the picker filter checks
 * `ad.id in BOARD_KIND_LABELS`, and registration inserts the label.
