/**
 * lineModels — the registry of line-owning sensor models, and the shape of
 * one.
 *
 * A line-owning sensor is a device that answers the guest on a wire the guest
 * also drives (DHT22, DS18B20, an IR demodulator) or on a companion wire it
 * pulses back (HC-SR04's ECHO). Its MODEL is real per-device behaviour — the
 * waveform it answers with — and belongs in one file per device under
 * `./models/`. Everything else about hosting such a sensor is generic and
 * lives in {@link LineSensorHub}: which pad events reach the model, where its
 * edges go, how its pads are claimed, and when the board's clock may skip.
 *
 * Adding a sensor is therefore two data edits and no code edits anywhere else:
 * one entry in `simulation/sensorModels.ts` (the canvas-facing declaration:
 * which component pins carry data, which properties the model reads) and one
 * `registerLineModel(sensorType, factory)` call in a new file under
 * `./models/`. No simulator, bridge or engine learns the sensor's name; they
 * only ever see frames and cycle counts.
