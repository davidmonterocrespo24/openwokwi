/**
 * requestLine — what a canvas part calls instead of poking a simulator for

 * there.
 *
 * The part states what it is (`sensor_type`), which board pins it sits on and
 * its current property values, and gets back one of three answers:
 *
 *   local   the board's own hub attached the model; the part forwards property
 *           updates to `update()` and calls `release()` on unmount.
 *   hosted  the model runs elsewhere (a backend worker, an engine's hub) and
 *           the board was told; same two methods.
 *   none    the board cannot host this sensor. The part gets `why`, the gap is
 *           recorded for the circuit check, and nothing pretends to work.
 *
 * The part never learns which host it got, and the host never learns which
 * part asked.
